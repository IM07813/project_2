Title: Enhancing Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning Techniques

Introduction: In this project, we focus on improving the accuracy of pneumonia detection using X-ray images. 
The dataset used for this purpose has been sourced from Kaggle and consists of X-ray images categorized as either normal or indicative of pneumonia. 
To achieve higher prediction accuracy and reduce the number of epochs required for training,
we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and leverage transfer learning techniques. 
The detailed methodology and implementation can be found within the accompanying IPython Notebook (ipynb) file.

Dataset:

    The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
    It comprises X-ray images that are categorized into two classes: normal and indicative of pneumonia.
    This dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing our CNN model for pneumonia detection.

Methodology:

    We employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.
    CNNs are a type of deep learning model that excel in image recognition tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and extract features
    from raw images.
    In our project, the CNN model is designed to differentiate between normal and pneumonia-affected X-ray images.

Transfer Learning:

    To enhance the prediction accuracy and reduce the number of required training epochs, we leverage transfer learning techniques.
    Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained CNN model, which has already learned relevant features from a similar dataset, 
    as the starting point for our model.
    By fine-tuning the pre-trained model with our dataset, we can achieve higher accuracy in a shorter amount of time compared to 
    training a CNN model from scratch.

Implementation:

    The project is implemented using an IPython Notebook (ipynb) file, which contains the code, visualizations,
    and explanations for each step of the process.
    The notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the methodology, model architecture, transfer learning techniques,
    and evaluation metrics used in this project.

Conclusion: Through the use of a CNN model and transfer learning techniques, this project demonstrates an effective approach to enhance 
pneumonia detection using X-ray images. The accompanying IPython Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the methodology and implementation, 
serving as a valuable resource for those interested in deep learning applications for medical image analysis.
