In this project, we have utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which comprises X-ray images categorized as either normal or indicative of
pneumonia. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and leveraging transfer learning techniques, we have been able to
enhance the prediction accuracy while reducing the number of required epochs for training. Further details and explanations regarding the
methodology and implementation can be found within the accompanying IPython Notebook (ipynb) file.
